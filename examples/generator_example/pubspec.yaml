  #Because no versions of json_serializable match >6.10.0 <7.0.0 and json_serializable 6.10.0 depends on analyzer ^7.4.0, json_serializable ^6.10.0 requires analyzer ^7.4.0.
  #And because every version of flutter_isar_generator_fixed from path depends on analyzer ^8.1.1, json_serializable ^6.10.0 is incompatible with flutter_isar_generator_fixed from path.
  #So, because generator_example depends on both flutter_isar_generator_fixed from path and json_serializable ^6.10.0, version solving failed.

# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:
  # assets:
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
  #
  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts in packages, see
